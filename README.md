# Elite Dangerous plugin for Macro Deck 2
A collection of some useful features for controlling Elite Dangerous

### To use any of the pre-made macros, you must have Elite Dangerous installed on your computer and have the game running in the background. You must also assign any keyboard shortcut in the controls menu to the actions you want to use in the game.

## This version does not support configuration updates, so if you make any changes to the controls menu, make sure you restart the application.

### This is a plugin for [Macro Deck 2](https://github.com/SuchByte/Macro-Deck), it does NOT function as a standalone app
